# Wings And Inspiration
Stream One Project: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute
 
This website will offer all women that have just arrived in Sweden, the opportunity to get in contact with a great companion. Under the umbrella of Wings and Inspiration project, Denisse will offer her coaching to help them adapt to their new country the best way, and be able to live their Expat life to the fullest.
 
## UX
This project was a tailored development for Denisse, who is an expat and coach. She started her website on WordPress but struggled and did not get it the way she wanted. She did not have a clear objective of what she wanted to accomplish with her site.
 
Her original website [here](https://github.com/Mlince79/WingsAndInspiration/blob/master/assets/images/Original%20home.jpg).
 
While listening to her story and after little research, we came up with the idea of focusing her coaching efforts on a specific and fascinating group in Sweden, Expat women.
 
The number of women coming into the country has been growing for the past 18 years, reaching its highest peak in 2016 with 71,859.
 
The number of immigrants per year from 2000 can be check [here](https://github.com/Mlince79/WingsAndInspiration/blob/master/assets/images/antal-invandrade-per-ar-fran-ar-2000%20(1).jpeg)
 
Denisse has as a personal call. She is passionate about helping women that are going through the process of:
- understanding a new culture,
- learning a new language,
- getting a job or working in a different cultural environment.
She wants to increase her contact with newcomers' women in Sweden. So users will benefit from her coaching, adapting quickly to their new country. In the future, she Expects that Wings And Inspiration became a more significant concept. Maybe the most prominent network where they can find calm and caring about their situation in life. 
 
Now, there are several groups created by Expat women where they can help each other. However, there is no personal coaching service offered.
